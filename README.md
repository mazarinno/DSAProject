# DSAProject
DSA SNHU Mod8 Project


For this course, the problems solved in each assignment were to construct different algorithms for essentially the same tasks. I approached the problem by studying these algorithms, looking at examples of them, and then applying them to the specific program needed. While doing the activities, I overcame any roadblocks through the debugging process by correcting errors shown in the program's output. Work on these projects has expanded my approach and evolved my way of writing programs since this marks my first written BST.
